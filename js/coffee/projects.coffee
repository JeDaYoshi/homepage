    Samplasion's Blog is my personal Blog where I post all kinds of stuff regarding everything I love,
    ranging fron consoles to Mac tricks to PC modding stories.
</p>
<p class="subtitle">
    It's up since 2017 (though, to be completely honest, it's got its fair share of domain changes).
    I love writing for it. In fact, I always have 3-4 articles in queue.
</p>
<p class="subtitle">
    I said queue because I've set it up to automatically publish posts every Saturday
    at 10:00 AM UTC+2. I've set it up this way because I'm a very forgetting person. It's happened
    quite a few times that I forgot to publish an article on time, so that's my safety net.

<p class="subtitle">
    Samplasion's Blog Comments was a project I made with the help of my friend, <a href="http://miky.ml">Miky88</a>.
    The idea was to create an entirely personalizable comment system for <a href="#blogProject">my blog</a>.
    And I'd say the idea was successful! I'd got a customizable backend, a flexible frontend and a wide range of options to choose from,
    other than a super nice admin panel.
</p>
<p class="subtitle">
    I'm planning on adding support for other websites (self-hosted, obviously; I'm not
    able to afford a VPS of my own, how can I host an entire comment service?).
</p>
<p class="subtitle">
    It was used in my blog, but I ultimately discontinued it because I changed the blog's theme and it wasn't
    worth it to keep changing the comments, too.

    A small web app I built in my free time that allows one to create and edit Playrix's AW80D levels.
    It's still very basic, but it includes ways to modify every single one of the sensible
    options of the game.

    I planned on making a companion User editor, but I've yet to find motivation to do it.
